# In Depth Install Instructions
Silver Daze Archipelago only works on Silver Daze version GOLD 1.4.1 or later. If your game isn't up to date, please update it before installing this APWorld.
This APWorld was created for Archipelago version 0.6.4 and may not be compatible with earlier versions. [Click here to install the latest version of Archipelago.](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

To begin, download the ArchipelagoSilverDaze.json file.
Open up your install directory for Silver Daze and place this file into the WWW folder.
This file doesn't do anything on its own, except inform the game that it can play Archipelago.
Now that the game is set up, we can install your APWorld.

Download the silverdaze.apworld file and open your Archipelago install.
Select "Install APWorld", then navigate to the location of your silverdaze.apworld and select it.
To create a yaml, select Generate Template Options, then navigate to the "Players/Templates" folder in your Archipelago install.
Finally, open up the Silver Daze.yaml file and edit your settings to suit your preferences.

## How To Generate A Game
Collect the .yaml files for each player and place them in the Players folder in your Archipelago install.
Then, open the launcher and select "Generate". This will open a terminal which will begin generating your game.
If nothing went wrong, the terminal will close on its own, and a .zip file will appear in your Output folder.

## Hosting A Game
To host a game, go to the [Archipelago Hosting Page](https://archipelago.gg/uploads) and click "Upload File".
Navigate to your Output folder and select the .zip file you generated. When given the option, select "Create Room".
This will bring you to a room where you can connect to the server to play the generated game. Share the room's link with all players.

## Connecting Your Game
Open up Silver Daze and select New Game.
The game will give you a few options. Select "Archipelago".
Now, the game will ask you to enter the host name. If you are hosting your game on the Archipelago server, simply press Enter to skip to the next step.
Next, you'll be asked your room number. This is the five digit number at the end of the server address.
Finally, you'll be asked your player name. Simply enter the name associated with your slot in the room.
